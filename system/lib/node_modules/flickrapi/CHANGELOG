v0.3.35
  * tags can now include the apostrophe (') character

v0.3.33
  * Authenticate is now exiting, rather than wrapping the entire
    life of the API object.

v0.3.31
  * Uploads can use tags either in string form or in array form.

v0.3.30
  * API functions that have optional authentication (such as
    flickr.people.getPhotos) can now be told to explicitly use
    authenticated calls, by passing in "authenticated: true"
    as part of the function call options.

v0.3.24
  * The library can now be used to upload photos to Flickr.

v0.3.23
  * private photos are now downloaded during --downsync, provided
    that the `force_auth` option is set in the flickr options, with
    the ia function (src/handlers/ia.js) now having an options
    object that can take a "loadPrivate" boolean property. If
    false or omitted, private photos and photosets are filtered
    out of the keysets for each. If true, photos and photosets
    are left unfiltered and will show up if you do things based
    on photo_keys and photoset_keys. (see README.md)

v0.3.22
  * Rewrote the downsync code to sommething a little more
    sensible, and changed the downsync order from
    photos/sets/collections to collections/sets/photos,
    so that changes to the collection and set metadata aren't
    held up by potentially thousands of photograph checks.

v0.3.21
  * Added "force_auth" as possible flickrOptions property,
    which allows you to force authed API calls for functions
    that do not require auth, but may generate more data if
    authed (such as the photos.search function, which does
    public searching without auth, but can return private
    data when authed).

v0.3.20
  * fixed some remaining http: protocol URLs to be https:

v0.3.19
  * fixed lingering bug in tokenOnly() behaviour

v0.3.18
  * switch image download protocol from http: to https: due
    to a change in Flickr's infrastructure to https-only.

v0.3.17
  * added catching "no response" errors when querying Flickr.

v0.3.14
  * Added "token only" access, so that the public Flickr API
    calls do not require you to authenticate through oauth.

v0.3.13
  * Updated the authentication endpoints to the correct endpoints

v0.3.12
  * fixed infinite retries on downloading images

v0.3.11
  * Added additional options to control the authentication
    procedure in terms of console logging, opening browsers,
    etc. See the Custom authentication section in the README
    for additional details.

v0.3.8
  * Image downloads from Flickr that result in incomplete images
    will make the download module redownload the file. For JPG
    images this means looking for 0xFFD9 as last two bytes,
    for PNG files the code looks for the IEND chunk in the PNG
    data. No more 0 byte or half-finished images (hopefully).

v0.3.0
  * In order to align the module with the Flickr API's property
    names, the "key" property has been renamed to "api_key" in
    the client-side library, as well as the server-side module.
    As this breaks upgrades, the version has been moved up from
    0.2 to 0.3
  * The clientside library can be given a custom endpoint to
    make it query proxies for the Flickr API, to get around
    the security problems that stem from having a client side
    library needing to use private credentials.

v0.2.27
  * oauth authentication now allows you to specify your own
    callback endpoint. If not specified, the out-of-band method
    is still used, requiring users to type an authentication
    code that they receive in the browser. Otherwise all they
    have to do is press the "I authorise this app" button.
  * updated the test.js file to allow one-step downsyncing,
    to save people the hassle of having to write an app around
    the module. If you just want your flickr data, add your
    Flickr API key information to the .env file, and then call
    "node test --downsync"

v0.2.26
  * Flickr API proxying, so that your app can use query flickr
    server side and send the response back over your own API
    url. Because client-side Flickr-API calls cannot be signed
    securely.

v0.2.25
  * client side improvment: much smaller production library,
    acceptably sized dev library.
  * README documentation ammended for client-side library use.

v0.2.22
  * also compiles to client-side library now, with a precompiled
    library in the ./browser directory.

v0.2.21
  * all code uses strict pragma, and passes linting.

v0.2.18
  * added collection icon image mirroring, so you don't need
    to create your own pinhead collages.

v0.2.16
  * "on downsync complete" callback added

v0.2.14
  * downsync will now prune entries that you removed from Flickr,
    but still have in your mirror, but only when the `downsync`
    function is called with the option second `removeDeleted`
    parameter set to `true`.

v0.2.11
  * updated the progress package. It's now well-behaved on OSX.

v0.2.9
  * downsync now updates entries on disk that were updated on Flickr
    since the last downsync, rather than requiring you delete your
    ia directory and redownloading all the .json data.

v0.2.8
  * photos are correctly sorted in photosets

v0.2.6
  * comments and contexts are cross-referenced into photos

v0.2.5
  * functions calls are always correctly auth'd
  * app permissions can be passed during the `authenticate` call,
    defaulting to "read".

v0.2.1
  * downsync now downloads:
    - comments for each photo
    - contexts for each photo
  * "large" and "medium 800" images are downloaded for each photo
  * photos now indicate the image sizes that Flickr has for them

v0.1.x
  * downsync downloads:
    - photos
    - photosets
    - collections
